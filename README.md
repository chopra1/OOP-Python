Python: Object Oriented Programming
• In Object Oriented programming model, focus is on data(objects) rather than functions.
• To represent real world entities, classes and objects are used.
• Classes acts as blueprints and using these classes, objects are created.

Some of the features of an object oriented programming language are:
• Classes
• Objects
• Inheritance
• Polymorphism
• Encapsulation

In Object Oriented programming model, focus is on data(objects) rather than functions.
To represent real world entities, classes and objects are used.
A class is just like a blueprint, it defines what properties an object will posses.
A class can contain multiple methods.
To define a method in a class, def keyword is used along with proper indentation.
Through inheritance, a class can inherit properties from another class.
